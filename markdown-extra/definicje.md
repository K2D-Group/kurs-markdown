# Definicje

Markdown Extra implements definition lists. Definition lists are made of terms and definitions of these terms, much like in a dictionary.

A simple definition list in Markdown Extra is made of a single-line term followed by a colon and the definition for that term.

```
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
Terms must be separated from the previous definition by a blank line. Definitions can span on multiple lines, in which case they should be indented. But you donâ€™t really have to: if you want to be lazy, you could forget to indent a definition that span on multiple lines and it will still work:

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
```

Each of the preceding definition lists will give the same HTML result:

```
<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
<dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
the family Rosaceae.</dd>

<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</dd>
</dl>
```

Colons as definition markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. Definition markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab.

Definition lists can have more than one definition associated with one term:

```
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.
:   An American computer company.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
```

You can also associate more than one term to a definition:

```
Term 1
Term 2
:   Definition a

Term 3
:   Definition b
```

If a definition is preceded by a blank line, Markdown Extra will wrap the definition in <p> tags in the HTML output. For example, this:

```
Apple

:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.

Orange

:    The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
```

will turn into this:

```
<dl>
<dt>Apple</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
the family Rosaceae.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>
<p>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
```

And just like regular list items, definitions can contain multiple paragraphs, and include other block-level elements such as blockquotes, code blocks, lists, and even other definition lists.

```
Term 1

:   This is a definition with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum 
    dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam 
    hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus.

:   Second definition for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
    because of the blank line preceding it.

Term 2

:   This definition has a code block, a blockquote and a list.

        code block.

    > block quote
    > on two lines.

    1.  first list item
    2.  second list item
